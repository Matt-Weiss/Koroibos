# Koroibos

  This project is the Turing Mod 4 final project. This is a 48 hour code challenge and will be evaluated based on everything we've learned so far, including documentation, processes, and the actual code.

  Because this project is a representation of everything we've learned so far, I've opted to complete it in Rails. I feel that documentation and process are important and if I were to have attempted this in a different language it would be functionally complete but weak in the other areas.

  Project is deployed at https://vast-inlet-82463.herokuapp.com/
